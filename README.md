I am currently pursuing a B.Tech. in Biotechnology at NSUT. I have a basic understanding of Python and C++. In addition to my academic interests, I maintain a blog at [codedrinc.blogspot.com](https://codedrinc.blogspot.com) where I share my thoughts and experiences. Outside of academics and blogging, I enjoy playing football and guitar.
